# CodeStorm: C Programming Bootcamp by Brain Stormers

Welcome to the official repository of **CodeStorm: From Hello World to Game World** — a 3-day beginner-friendly C programming bootcamp organized by Brain Stormers.

This repository contains all the codes and modules taught across the three days. Each day builds up your understanding, culminating in the creation of a terminal-based **Tic Tac Toe game**.

## 📅 Day 1: Hello World & Core Concepts
**Goal**: Learn the basic syntax, input/output, and arithmetic operations in C.

### 🔹 Files:
- `hello_world.c` – Your first C program to print "Hello World!".
- `variables.c` – Introduction to different data types: `int`, `float`, `char`.
- `input_output.c` – Using `scanf` and `printf` for interaction.
- `calculator.c` – Add, multiply, and find average of two numbers.

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- Data Types & Variables
- Operators
- Basic Input/Output

## 📅 Day 2: Logic Building & Modular Code
**Goal**: Dive into decision-making, loops, arrays, and functions.

### 🔹 Files:
- `grade_checker.c` – Use of `if-else` for decision making.
- `day_switch.c` – Using `switch-case` to print day names.
- `number_table.c` – Print multiplication table using loops.
- `sum_even_odd.c` – Sum of even/odd numbers using conditions.
- `marks_array.c` – Store and access marks using arrays.
- `function_basics.c` – First look at user-defined functions.
- `calculator_modular.c` – Function-based calculator.

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- Conditional Statements: `if`, `else`, `switch`
- Loops: `for`, `while`, `do-while`
- Arrays
- Functions

## 📅 Day 3: Project – Tic Tac Toe Game
**Goal**: Apply all your learning to build a 2-player Tic Tac Toe game in C.

### 🔹 Files:
- `game_plan.txt` – A text-based breakdown of the game logic.
- `displayBoard.c` – Displays the board layout in the terminal.
- `markBoard.c` – Logic to place the player's mark (X or O).
- `checkForWin.c` – Conditions to check win or draw.
- `tic_tac_toe.c` – Full game combining all modules.

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- Modular programming using functions
- Game logic and flow
- Validation and loops

## 💻 Getting Started
To run any of the `.c` files:
1. Open them using **Code::Blocks**, **DevC++**, or any C IDE.
2. Compile and Run.
3. For command-line users:
```bash
gcc filename.c -o output && ./output
```
